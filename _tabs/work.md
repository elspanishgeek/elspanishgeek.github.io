## Professional Journey
My engineering career started as a Product (Hardware & Firmware) Engineer for IBM in 2011. I worked for a wonderful team in charge of supporting and troubleshooting the [POWER7 architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER7) servers. After coding an incredibly inefficient but incredibly effective VBA program to interpolate data in a 100,000 row database, my manager referred me to the [WebSphere Applicaton Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_WebSphere_Application_Server) team across the street. I worked with Systems Management team and a slew of incredibly smart people who mentored me and instilled in me some of the best practices I still follow today.

I left with two other IBMers in 2015 and we created, Tastegraphy, a platform that catalogued taste preferences from users in exchanged for personalized dish recommendations for surrounding restaurants. This data would be compiled to predict trends to sell to major food manufacturers spending millions in R&D to find the next product to put on shelves.

My leadership style:
Galvanizing. We are Sisyphus, and together, we are going to make it to the top of the mountain.
